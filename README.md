# Agency First AI (AFAI) — Core Repository

Welcome to the **central hub for Agency First AI**, a framework and demonstration for prioritizing human agency in AI systems.

## About

**Agency First AI (AFAI)** is a design paradigm that ensures AI systems **preserve, measure, and protect human agency** above all else. This repo contains:

- The **manifesto**: outlines the concept, APS metrics, and operational principles.  
- **Demo harness**: reproducible scripts for simulating AI agents and calculating Agency Preservation Scores (APS).  
- Supporting **assets**: video explanations, diagrams, and outputs.

## Manifesto

> Humans retain the right to make meaningful decisions. AFAI is not a moral crusade—it’s a practical framework ensuring that as AI systems become powerful, human choice remains intact, measurable, and protected.
