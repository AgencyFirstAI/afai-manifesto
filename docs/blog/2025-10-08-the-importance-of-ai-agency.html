                        <p>As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly intertwined with our daily lives, it's crucial that we consider the impact these powerful systems have on our ability to make our own choices. At Agency First AI (AFAI), we believe that human agency—the capacity to make informed, voluntary, and meaningful decisions—is a fundamental right that must be preserved and protected.</p>
                        <p>In a world where AI can influence everything from the news we read to the products we buy, it's easy to see how our choices can be subtly manipulated. Opaque algorithms can steer us down paths we might not have otherwise chosen, and the convenience of AI-powered recommendations can lead to a gradual erosion of our own decision-making muscles.</p>
                        <p>The AFAI framework is our answer to this challenge. By prioritizing transparency, consent, and optionality, we can build AI systems that empower users rather than control them. Our Agency Preservation Score (APS) provides a concrete way to measure and evaluate the impact of AI on human agency, giving developers the tools they need to create more responsible and ethical AI.</p>
                        <p>We believe that the future of AI should be one of collaboration, not coercion. By putting human agency first, we can ensure that AI serves humanity, not the other way around.</p>
                        <p>Join us in our mission to build a future where AI and human agency can coexist and thrive.</p>
