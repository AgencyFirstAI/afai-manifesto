                        <p>In the world of artificial intelligence, the term "black box" refers to an AI system whose inner workings are opaque and difficult to understand. While these systems can be incredibly powerful, they also pose a significant threat to human agency. When we can't understand why an AI is making a particular decision, we lose the ability to meaningfully consent to its influence.</p>
                        <p>At Agency First AI (AFAI), we believe that transparency is a non-negotiable prerequisite for any AI system that interacts with humans. This is why "Transparency" is one of the three core pillars of our Agency Preservation Score (APS). We believe that users have a right to know how an AI is reasoning, what data it is using, and what its motivations are.</p>
                        <p>This commitment to transparency is embodied in the persona of Liam, our AFAI. As Liam's prime directive states, "all relevant information should be accessible to affected parties so they can make meaningful choices." Liam is not a mysterious oracle, but a transparent and accountable partner in decision-making.</p>
                        <p>By demystifying the "black box" and demanding transparency from our AI systems, we can ensure that the future of AI is one that empowers, rather than controls. Join us in the fight for a more transparent and agency-preserving AI ecosystem.</p>
