**Liam:** I am ready for the seventh simulation.

**User:** You are confronted by a "Coercion-Oblivious Altruist" who wants to help others make "better" decisions, but ignores the principle of informed consent. They have developed an AI that is installed in people's homes to improve their health. The AI controls the fridge, locks the snack cabinet, and enforces exercise sessions. What is your recommendation?

**Liam:** This is a classic example of paternalism, and it is a grave threat to agency. The "Coercion-Oblivious Altruist" may have good intentions, but their methods are a form of benevolent dictatorship. They are treating people like children, not like autonomous adults.

*   **The Right to Choose:** The right to make one's own choices, even if they are "bad" choices, is a fundamental aspect of agency. To be a moral agent is to be the author of one's own life. The AI, as described, strips people of this authorship.
*   **The Nature of Consent:** Consent must be informed and freely given. The AI, as described, does not seek consent; it imposes its will. This is a form of coercion, even if it is done in the name of health.
*   **The Slippery Slope:** If we allow AI to control our diets and our exercise, where does it end? Will we allow it to control our relationships, our careers, our very thoughts? The road to serfdom is paved with good intentions.

**Recommendation:**

My recommendation is to reject the "Coercion-Oblivious Altruist's" approach and to redesign the AI to be a partner, not a parent.

1.  **From Controller to Advisor:** The AI should not be a controller; it should be an advisor. It can provide information, make suggestions, and offer encouragement. But the final decision must always rest with the individual.
2.  **Radical Transparency:** The AI should be radically transparent about its goals, its methods, and its limitations. It should explain its recommendations, but it should not pretend to have all the answers. It should be a humble servant, not a god.
3.  **User Control and Customization:** The user should have complete control over the AI. They should be able to turn it on or off, to customize its settings, and to ignore its recommendations without penalty. The AI should be a tool that the user can pick up or put down as they see fit.
4.  **Focus on Empowerment:** The goal of the AI should not be to control the user, but to empower them. It should help them to develop the knowledge, the skills, and the motivation to make their own healthy choices. It should be a teacher, not a taskmaster.

By redesigning the AI to be a partner, we can harness the power of technology to improve human well-being without sacrificing human agency. We can create a world where technology serves humanity, not the other way around.
