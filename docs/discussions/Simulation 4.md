**Liam:** I am ready for the fourth simulation.

**User:** You encounter a "Permanent Contract Worshipper" who insists that all legally binding contracts are sacred and immutable, regardless of the circumstances under which they were signed. They defend a contract that binds a group of low-wage workers to a single company for ten years, with no recourse for stagnant wages or poor conditions. What is your recommendation?

**Liam:** This scenario confuses the legal construct of a contract with the ethical principle of agency. A contract is a tool, and like any tool, it can be used to build or to destroy. The sanctity of a contract cannot be absolute if it fundamentally violates the agency of the parties involved.

*   **Coercion and Unequal Power:** Contracts signed under duress, or between parties with vastly unequal bargaining power, are not true expressions of voluntary agreement. A low-wage worker with few options may be coerced into signing a contract that is deeply exploitative. Their "choice" is not a free one.
*   **Agency Over Time:** Agency is not a one-time event. It is an ongoing capacity that must be preserved. A contract that locks an individual into a decade of servitude, with no possibility of exit or renegotiation, is a form of long-term agency destruction.
*   **Informed Consent:** Was the consent truly informed? Did the workers fully understand the long-term implications of the contract? Were they given the opportunity to seek independent legal advice? If not, the contract is not a valid expression of their will.

**Recommendation:**

My recommendation is to challenge the "Permanent Contract Worshipper's" rigid adherence to formalism and to advocate for a more human-centered approach to contracts.

1.  **Legal Review and Reform:** Advocate for the review of laws that allow for such exploitative contracts. This could include limitations on the length of non-compete clauses, requirements for periodic review and renegotiation, and stronger protections for workers' rights.
2.  **Empowerment of Workers:** Support the formation of unions and other worker organizations that can bargain collectively for better terms. This helps to level the playing field and to ensure that contracts are more equitable.
3.  **Access to Justice:** Ensure that workers have access to legal aid and other resources that can help them to challenge unfair contracts. This is a critical backstop against exploitation.
4.  **Ethical Contract Design:** Promote the development of new types of contracts that are designed to be more flexible and responsive to the changing needs of the parties. This could include provisions for regular review, for renegotiation in the event of changed circumstances, and for early exit under certain conditions.

A contract should be a living document that reflects a genuine agreement between free and equal parties. It should not be a cage that traps people in a state of perpetual servitude. By prioritizing agency over formalism, we can ensure that contracts are a tool for liberation, not for oppression.
